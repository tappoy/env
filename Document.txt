package env // import "github.com/tappoy/env"

This module provides the ability to retrieve environment variables with default
values and types. It also provides the ability to set dummy values for ease of
testing.

VARIABLES

var (
	// DummyEnv is the map that stores dummy values for the environment variable.
	// This is used for testing.
	DummyEnv = map[string]string{}

	// Exit is the function that calls os.Exit normally.
	// If you want test, you can replace this function with a mock function.
	Exit = os.Exit

	// Out is the variable that stores the output of os.Stdout.
	// If you want test, you can replace this variable with a mock variable.
	Out = os.Stdout

	// Err is the variable that stores the output of os.Stderr.
	// If you want test, you can replace this variable with a mock variable.
	Err = os.Stderr

	// In is the variable that stores the input of os.Stdin.
	// If you want test, you can replace this variable with a mock variable.
	In = os.Stdin

	// Args is the variable that stores the arguments of os.Args.
	// If you want test, you can replace this variable with a mock variable.
	Args = os.Args
)

FUNCTIONS

func Getenv(key string, defaultValue string) string
    Getenv is the function that returns the value of the environment variable
    as a string. The value is searched in the DummyEnv first, and if it is not
    found, it is searched by os.Getenv. Finally, if the value is not found,
    it returns the defaultValue.

func GetenvInt(key string, defaultValue int) (int, error)
    Getenv is the function that returns the value of the environment variable as
    a int. The value is searched in the DummyEnv first, and if it is not found,
    it is searched by os.Getenv. Finally, if the value is not found, it returns
    the defaultValue. If the value is not a number, it returns the defaultValue
    and an error.
